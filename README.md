    This will start the development server and you can view the app by navigating to `http://localhost:5173` in your web browser.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **LocalStorage**: A web storage API for storing data locally in the user's browser.

## Approach

The development process of this app involved the following steps:

1. **UI Construction**: Designed and built the user interface, ensuring a clean and user-friendly experience.
2. **LocalStorage Integration**: Integrated LocalStorage to save and retrieve notes.
3. **Markdown Support**: Implemented an editor and preview option for notes written in markdown format.
4. **Recent Notes Sidebar**: Added a sidebar to display a list of recent notes.

## Known Issues and Limitations

- **LocalStorage Limitations**: LocalStorage has a limited storage capacity, which might affect the app's performance with a large number of notes.
- **Error Handling**: There might be limited error handling for various edge cases, such as exceeding LocalStorage capacity or unsupported markdown syntax.
